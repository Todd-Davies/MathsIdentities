MathsIdentities
===============

Formats my list of maths identities as a PNG from a LATEX text file.

It outputs two .png files, the front and back of the sheet. The idea is that you print these files onto two sides of paper.

#Features
- Variable cell size
- Variable number of columns
- Uses LATEX for easy formatting
- You can pass in any set of questions
