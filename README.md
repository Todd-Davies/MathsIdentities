MathsIdentities
===============

Formats my list of maths identities as a png from a LATEX text file. The png images can then be printed and cut out to be made into flash cards.

It outputs two .png files, the front and back of the sheet. The idea is that you print these files onto two sides of paper.

#Features
- Variable cell size
- Variable number of columns
